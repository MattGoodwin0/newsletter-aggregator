## The Problem

Continuous learning is essential for developers to stay current with the latest industry trends, market conditions, frameworks, libraries, tooling. Over the years I've subscribed to daily and weekly emails from various sources and have a number of saved bookmarks for my go-to media sources to read up on the latest developments across the industry.

The problem? Well.... it's a pain to switch between the different sources I get and they're not that great to read. I love great UX and as a developer I'm always looking at how I can improve things with digital solutions.

## The Idea

What if I could consolidate all the sources into one beautifully designed digital magazine, that I can sit down with at the end of the week, coffee in hand, relaxing music on the headphones and catch-up with the latest development. Being inspired and sparking new ideas I can apply to my day-to-day work.

## The Solution

I sat down at drafted an MVP, consuming the most loved technology subscription... TLDR.

I wrote a relatively simple python script that fetches and scrapes content from an RSS feed for X number of days and produces a PDF, fully customisable with a HTML and CSS built template.

## The Future

Building on this project includes adding more sources and improving the design so meet the dream I have in mind. That being said, I'm already sitting down with at the end of the week, coffee in hand, relaxing music on the headphones and catch-up with the latest development.... even if it is just TLDR sources..... for now!
